# TIMER IP VIA APB PROTOCOL
- Timer is an essential module for every chip.
- This is used to generate accurate timing interval or controlling the timing of various operations within the circuit. Timer can be used in various application: pulse generation, delay generation, event generation, PWM generation, Interrupt generation â€¦.
- In this project, a timer module is customized from CLINT module of industrial RISC-V architecture. It is used to generate interrupt based on user settings.
- The spec of CLINT can be referred at: https://chromitem-soc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/clint.html
- The timer has following features:
+ 64-bit count-up
+ 12-bit address
+ Register set is configured via APB bus (IP is APB slave)
+ Support wait state (1 cycle is enough) and error handling
+ Support byte access
+ Support halt (stop) in debug mode
+ Timer uses active low async reset
+ Counter can be counted based on the system clock or divided up to 256
+ Support timer interrupt (can be enabled or disabled)
+ Coverage achieved is 100%
